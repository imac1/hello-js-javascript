# Hello Js

## Story

So HTML has the content and CSS has the looks... but who has the brains?
In this step-by-step guide, you are going find out what super powers `js` has.
Beware, with great power, comes great responsibility!

## What are you going to learn?

- for loops
- if statements
- variables

## Tasks

1. Say `Hello World` in the console and in an alert box.
    - When the `index.html` file is opened in a browser, an alert box appears with the words `Hello World - Alert`.
    - When the `index.html` file is opened in a browser, and the developer tools are opened in the console tab, the text `Hello World - Console` appears.

2. Display the current hour in the console. (use the `new Date` function.)
    - When the `index.html` file is opened in a browser, and the developer tools are opened in the console tab, a text with the current hour appears. (For example, 14 is displayed if the current hour is 14:34.)

3. Read two numbers from the prompt and display their sum in an alert.
    - When the `index.html` file is opened in a browser, two alert boxes appear, asking the user for input.
    - If `1` and `2` are written in the alert boxes, a third alert box appears with the text `3`.

4. If in any of the two prompts contain a value that cannot be converted to a number, an alert appears.
    - When the user enters `sfd` in the first prompt, the second prompt does not appear. Instead, an alert is displayed, with the text `error for the first input`.
    - When the user enters `1` in the first prompt and `sdf` in the second prompt, an alert is displayed, with the text `error for the second input`.

5. Read a letter from a prompt and display all its letters in the console.
    - When the `index.html` file is opened in a browser, a prompt appears asking the user to type a word.
    - After the user types the word in the prompt, all letters of the word are printed in the console on a separate lineF (for example, for `world, w & o & r & l & d` is printed.)

6. Read a word from a prompt, and display the number of letters in it in the console.
    - When the `index.html` file is opened in a browser, a prompt appears, asking the user to type a word.
    - After the user types the word in the prompt, the number of letters in that word are displayed in the console (`5` for `hello`).
    - The space character is not considered a letter in the count (`hi bye` has `5` letters).

7. Read a word from a prompt and display its letters inversed in the console.
    - When the `index.html` file is opened in a browser, a prompt appears asking the user to type a word.
    - When the user types `hello` in the console the word `olleh` appears.

8. Display the sum of all odd numbers between 1 and a number entered in the prompt.
    - When the `index.html` file is opened in a browser, a prompt appears asking the user to type a number.
    - When the user enters `6` the value `9 (1 + 3 + 5)` is displayed in the console.
    - When the user enters `sfd` in the console the text `invalid number `is displayed.
